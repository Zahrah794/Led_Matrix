# Creating a LED Matrix Display: Designing and Displaying the Z Shape using Tinkercad
This project aims to create an LED matrix and utilize it to display a specific shape, in this case, the letter Z. The LED matrix is a display device consisting of a grid of individual light-emitting diodes (LEDs) arranged in a matrix pattern. Its purpose is to visually present information or generate various shapes and animations. By leveraging the matrix's organization into rows and columns, specific LEDs can be selectively activated to form desired patterns, such as letters, numbers, or graphics. The implementation of this project, using Tinkercad as the platform, involves designing and programming the LED matrix to display the Z shape. Tinkercad provides a simulated environment for testing and prototyping the LED matrix project.
